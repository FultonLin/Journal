May 4, 2017:
1. Create repository for group

One way Heroic:	Thoughts about how to code this
moving the character I can make it so when moving up or down you would also move left and when you reach a certain x coordinate as the character then you would
die
and when moving right or left it would seem like it is running from or to the darkness

Evoland: Thoughts about how to code this
create some fields that contain the properties that would become true once the player retrieves the specific item and then the code runs off the fact
if they are true or false and separate folders that would contain different changes around the world such as color or change in the graphics

obstacles:
ideas on how to code obstacles create a superclass which contains the general properties of an obstacles and a sub class would be a more specific containing more
properties that may be unique to it

accomplished:
created repository and thought about things that are needed for the games that we may code

tomorrow: 
Start creating and testing obstacles to see if it can actually work with each different kind of obstacles




May 5, 2017:

thought about how to create the illusion of the character icon moving where as the chracter icon is above the map and moves separately
started to get the map ready for all the items that will be on it

Tomorrow: create the map and continue testing obstacles and thoughts on how to do it



May 8, 2017:

started to create the overhead image and discusses on how to plan each square on the map such that we add the entity to each square in a 
2d array
-Discussing whether or not to use another game engine

tomorrow: finalize whether or not to use another engine



May 9, 2017:
Started to work on Slick2d files and added the jar files that are needed. Also started to learn about how to use these jar files.
Started on some preliminary files that will enable testing

Thoughts: Can create two different maps and one of them is better in graphics and when the player dicovers the chest which contains 
the upgrade to how the map will look towards the end

tomorrow:continue working on the starts and continue studying how to use slick

May 10, 2017:

tomorrow: start on the actual game and fix up the needed stuff.

may 12, 2017:
Could not get anything done because of the fact that the files are there but when running it gives me a java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError:
and could not find a solution

tomorrow:
hopefully can find a fix and then try to continue coding the stuff needed.

may 15, 2017:
fixed lwjgl error at home and decided to start coding the main menu and linked the two states or screens with each other

tomorrow: start on the map and maybe start on collision
