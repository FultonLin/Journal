1. Create repository for group

One way Heroic:	Thoughts about how to code this
moving the character I can make it so when moving up or down you would also move left and when you reach a certain x coordinate as the character then you would
die
and when moving right or left it would seem like it is running from or to the darkness

Evoland: Thoughts about how to code this
create some fields that contain the properties that would become true once the player retrieves the specific item and then the code runs off the fact
if they are true or false and separate folders that would contain different changes around the world such as color or change in the graphics

obstacles:
ideas on how to code obstacles create a superclass which contains the general properties of an obstacles and a sub class would be a more specific containing more
properties that may be unique to it

accomplished:
created repository and thought about things that are needed for the games that we may code

tomorrow: 
Start creating and testing obstacles to see if it can actually work with each different kind of obstacles
